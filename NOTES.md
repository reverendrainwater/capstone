##  Personal Notes

20170912 - Ncurses is a lot easier to use than anticipated.  Currently not much progress beyond learning some ncurses has been made since the past week has been quite hectic with various tests and large amount of work. 

20170920 - Why is javascript such garbage, I mean seriously. Who in their right mind thinks making changes so drastic as to break someone's whole project in _one version_? Only hipsters and people who want fancy things use this horrid language to do anything.

20170921 - Should consider using org-mode for notes, I wonder if Github supports it? We shall see after this note! Maybe then I can fully enjoy the **beauty** that is emacs and embrace the operating system entirely. Praise the Stallman.
